    Hello! I'm Surya Merala
    <div class="p">

        <p >
            At the Illinois Institute of Technology, I'm now working towards a master's degree in information technology management. Data analytics is my area of expertise. I have more than two years of worthwhile experience working in the IT sector as a Software QA Engineer in addition to my academic endeavours.
        </p>
    <p>
        During my tenure as a Software QA Engineer, my primary focus was on evaluating the functionality and usability of web applications from the end-user perspective. While I possess a strong understanding of web application frontend operations, my knowledge of the coding aspects, such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, is foundational. My expertise lies in meticulously testing web applications, ensuring that they meet quality standards, and providing valuable feedback to enhance user experience. Although I have a solid grasp of HTML and CSS for troubleshooting purposes, my main strength lies in assessing and assuring the overall functionality and user-friendliness of web interfaces. In summary, my background is rooted in the practical aspects of web application usage and quality assurance, with a foundational understanding of the coding elements that contribute to their frontend design and functionality.
